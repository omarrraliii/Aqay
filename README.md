# Aqay - Graduation Project

## Project Description

Aqay is a web platform developed as a graduation project by a group of five students from the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) at Cairo University. The project aims to provide a platform for local brands, enabling them to showcase their products and reach a broader audience.

## Project Overview

The name "Aqay" is derived from the pharo word, which means "market." This name encapsulates the project's core mission, which is to help local brands stand out and gain recognition in a competitive market. The platform offers a space for these brands to display their products, share their stories, and connect with potential customers.
