# Client-Server Architecture

This architecture involves dividing the system into two main components: clients and servers. 

- *Clients*: End-user devices that request services from servers.
- *Servers*: Provide resources or perform specific tasks.

Client-server architecture offers several advantages:

- *Distributed Processing*: Enables the distribution of processing tasks across multiple devices.
- *Scalability*: Allows for the system to handle increased loads by adding more servers.
- *Separation of Concerns*: Logic is separated between client-side and server-side, improving maintainability and developmentÂ flexibility.

**System Architecture Diagram: Aqay Front-End with React, Back-End with .NET, API, and MSSQL Server**

1. **Client Side (React):** User interacts with the React-based Aqay Front-End, sending HTTP requests to the .NET Web Server.

2. **Web Server (.NET):** .NET Web Server processes user requests, formulates SQL queries, and sends them to the MSSQL Server for database operations. It then awaits the response.

3. **Database (MSSQL Server):** MSSQL Server receives and processes SQL queries, performs CRUD operations on the Aqay database, and sends back the response to the Web Server.

4. **Response Flow:** The Web Server interprets the database response and structures it into a suitable format. The React Front-End receives the formatted response, updating the user interface accordingly.
