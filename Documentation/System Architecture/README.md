# Client-Server Architecture

This architecture involves dividing the system into two main components: clients and servers. 

- *Clients*: End-user devices that request services from servers.
- *Servers*: Provide resources or perform specific tasks.

Client-server architecture offers several advantages:

- *Distributed Processing*: Enables the distribution of processing tasks across multiple devices.
- *Scalability*: Allows for the system to handle increased loads by adding more servers.
- *Separation of Concerns*: Logic is separated between client-side and server-side, improving maintainability and developmentÂ flexibility.
